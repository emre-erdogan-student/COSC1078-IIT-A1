									<p> Name: Emre Erdogan <br>
									Student Number: s3858871 <br>

									<h3> Background Information </h3>
									<p> Hello everyone! Welcome to my first ever page. I'll be talking about myself, so you can get to know me better and the type of person I am. As previously mentioned, my name is Emre Erdogan, which has a meaning (surprisingly enough), and it means someone who is a loyal friend in my language. My nationality is Australian, and my cultural background is a mix of Turkish and Kurdish. Even though I am part Kurdish, I don't know how to speak it at all; however, when it comes to Turkish, I can speak it at a very high level. </p>
									<p> I am studying ISYS (Information Systems) and am currently in my last year! Which I am very excited about and can't wait to graduate. Before I got into ISYS, I did a diploma in International Business. However, that course didn't really interest me, and a mix of IT and Business was more of something that I wanted to do in the future. </p>
                  <br>
									<p> Here are some interesting facts about me: </p>
									<ul>
										<li> I am currently top 1000 in the Asia Pacific region in Valorant </li>
										<li> During my spare time I enjoy reading books, and my favorite book series is Lord of The Rings </li>
										<li> I like making new friends from around the world </li>
										<li> I am trying to learn Burmese </li>

									</ul>

									<h2>Interest in IT </h2>
									<span class="image right"><img src="interest-in-it-photo.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p style="font-weight:bold;">What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</p>
									<p> My interest in IT began in high school when I first started studying at a vocational school. At my vocational school, I had the choice to study specifically IT for the next three years (starting from year 9 to 12), and after considering my other options, IT caught more of my interest. This choice was hard to make, but looking at how integrated IT was in our lives and the advancing pace, I saw a better potential future for myself in that industry. In those three years, I took classes related to programming, web design, networks and working with databases; even though I enjoyed all of these classes, they didn't seem like something I wanted to do for the rest of my life. However, in my final year, we had to take an internship at an IT-related business of our choice. I came across a google partnered digital marketing agency that specialized in using the digital world to advertise and market various companies. Once I started my internship, I started learning various tools/methods like Google Ads, Facebook Ads, SEO etc. After learning the tools and getting my google ads certificates, I was trusted enough to have my own account to manage and set up new digital campaigns. Thanks to this experience, I gained much more interest in IT and decided on what I wanted to do in the future. </p>
                  <br>
                  <p style="font-weight:bold;">Why did you choose to come to RMIT? </p>
									<p> After coming back from Turkey to Australia, I wanted to continue studying and do a bachelor's degree. Because I came from Turkey, our education system didn't have an equivalent to the ATAR, so I was discouraged and limited in my choice when applying to universities. One of my friends that were studying for a bachelor of education at the time, recommended I take a pathway into RMIT. RMIT had many pathway options available to students without previous accreditations for getting into a bachelor's degree. I called up RMIT, spoke to one of the helpers who guided me through the process, and finally applied. They accepted me for the diploma of international business course in 2020, and I am continuing my educational journey studying Bachelor of Information Systems.     </p>

								  <p style="font-weight:bold;">What do you expect to learn during your studies?  </p>
									<p> By studying this course, I expect to gain knowledge of many aspects of information technology and the various industries it can be applied. As I will be graduating this year, I wanted to take this course so I can also learn how to enter the IT job market and what to expect. Even though we will be learning the many theoretical aspects of information technology, like how GitHub works,  HTML, CSS, Security, and different software, I am happy to know that we will also be applying the knowledge in the context of our very own innovative project. In our future assignments, we will be working with various people, which I believe will improve my team working skills and help me coordinate better with a team. I believe that once I have finished this course and found a job, I can better understand the IT side of a business and work with them more effectively. </p>

									<p style="font-weight:bold;"> The description of the position and what makes it appealing to me: </p>
									<p> The search ads 360 lead position puts you in the main role of managing multiple, high-level search marketing campaigns of the largest companies in the world. When working in this position, you will need to develop high-level marketing strategies for clients and guide them through the process. Furthermore, you are responsible for coming up with strategies to meet the certain goals of your key clients and provide constant support to them for new customer opportunities (Google, 2022). This role has high risks as they are responsible for search campaigns throughout Google and Microsoft Advertising and will need to work with million-dollar budgets. As the market and customer habits are constantly changing, you will need to learn and adapt to the new environments.  </p>
									<p> The reason why this role is appealing to me is that I've only ever worked with clients that are regionally based and have a lower budget to spare for digital advertising. I've always wanted to one day work with some of the biggest companies in the world (Sony, Amazon etc.) and help manage their search campaigns. If I get the chance to one day work in a search 360 role, I will have the hands-on experience of working with these multi-billion dollar companies and gain valuable knowledge. Working at Google in a leadership role comes with many benefits, from paid holidays to an excellent work-life balance and getting to work with some of the best. This is why this role is appealing to me.   </p>

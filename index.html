									<span class="image left"><img src="personal-image.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p> Name: Emre Erdogan <br>
									Student Number: s3858871 <br>

									<h3> Background Information </h3>
									<p> Hello everyone! Welcome to my first ever page. I'll be talking about myself, so you can get to know me better and the type of person I am. As previously mentioned, my name is Emre Erdogan and I'm 21 years old. My name has a meaning (surprisingly enough), and it means someone who is a loyal friend in my language.  My nationality is Australian, and my cultural background is a mix of Turkish and Kurdish. Even though I am part Kurdish, I don't know how to speak it at all; however, when it comes to Turkish, I can speak it at a very high level.  </p>
									<p> I am studying ISYS (Information Systems) and am currently in my last year! Which I am very excited about and can't wait to graduate. Before I got into ISYS, I did a diploma in International Business. However, that course didn't really interest me, and a mix of IT and Business was more of something that I wanted to do in the future. </p>
                  <br>
									<p> Here are some interesting facts about me: </p>
									<ul>
										<li> I am currently top 1000 in the Asia Pacific region in Valorant </li>
										<li> During my spare time I enjoy reading books, and my favorite book series is Lord of The Rings </li>
										<li> I like making new friends from around the world </li>
										<li> I am trying to learn Burmese </li>

									</ul>

									<h2>Interest in IT </h2>
									<span class="image right"><img src="interest-in-it-photo.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p style="font-weight:bold;">What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</p>
									<p> My interest in IT began in high school when I first started studying at a vocational school. At my vocational school, I had the choice to study specifically IT for the next three years (starting from year 9 to 12), and after considering my other options, IT caught more of my interest. This choice was hard to make, but looking at how integrated IT was in our lives and the advancing pace, I saw a better potential future for myself in that industry. In those three years, I took classes related to programming, web design, networks and working with databases; even though I enjoyed all of these classes, they didn't seem like something I wanted to do for the rest of my life. However, in my final year, we had to take an internship at an IT-related business of our choice. I came across a google partnered digital marketing agency that specialized in using the digital world to advertise and market various companies. Once I started my internship, I started learning various tools/methods like Google Ads, Facebook Ads, SEO etc. After learning the tools and getting my google ads certificates, I was trusted enough to have my own account to manage and set up new digital campaigns. Thanks to this experience, I gained much more interest in IT and decided on what I wanted to do in the future. </p>
                  <br>
                  <p style="font-weight:bold;">Why did you choose to come to RMIT? </p>
									<p> After coming back from Turkey to Australia, I wanted to continue studying and do a bachelor's degree. Because I came from Turkey, our education system didn't have an equivalent to the ATAR, so I was discouraged and limited in my choice when applying to universities. One of my friends that were studying for a bachelor of education at the time, recommended I take a pathway into RMIT. RMIT had many pathway options available to students without previous accreditations for getting into a bachelor's degree. I called up RMIT, spoke to one of the helpers who guided me through the process, and finally applied. They accepted me for the diploma of international business course in 2020, and I am continuing my educational journey studying Bachelor of Information Systems.     </p>

								  <p style="font-weight:bold;">What do you expect to learn during your studies?  </p>
									<p> By studying this course, I expect to gain knowledge of many aspects of information technology and the various industries it can be applied. As I will be graduating this year, I wanted to take this course so I can also learn how to enter the IT job market and what to expect. Even though we will be learning the many theoretical aspects of information technology, like how GitHub works,  HTML, CSS, Security, and different software, I am happy to know that we will also be applying the knowledge in the context of our very own innovative project. In our future assignments, we will be working with various people, which I believe will improve my team working skills and help me coordinate better with a team. I believe that once I have finished this course and found a job, I can better understand the IT side of a business and work with them more effectively. </p>

									<h2>Ideal Job </h2>
                  <span class="image"><img src="job_advertisement.png" alt="" /></span>

									<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/57123195"> Link to Application </a>

									<p style="font-weight:bold;"> The description of the position and what makes it appealing to me: </p>
									<p> The search ads 360 lead position puts you in the main role of managing multiple, high-level search marketing campaigns of the largest companies in the world. When working in this position, you will need to develop high-level marketing strategies for clients and guide them through the process. Furthermore, you are responsible for coming up with strategies to meet the certain goals of your key clients and provide constant support to them for new customer opportunities (Google, 2022). This role has high risks as they are responsible for search campaigns throughout Google and Microsoft Advertising and will need to work with million-dollar budgets. As the market and customer habits are constantly changing, you will need to learn and adapt to the new environments.  </p>
									<p> The reason why this role is appealing to me is that I've only ever worked with clients that are regionally based and have a lower budget to spare for digital advertising. I've always wanted to one day work with some of the biggest companies in the world (Sony, Amazon etc.) and help manage their search campaigns. If I get the chance to one day work in a search 360 role, I will have the hands-on experience of working with these multi-billion dollar companies and gain valuable knowledge. Working at Google in a leadership role comes with many benefits, from paid holidays to an excellent work-life balance and getting to work with some of the best. This is why this role is appealing to me.   </p>

									<p style="font-weight:bold;"> A description of the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position: </p>
									<p> Skills Required: </p>
									<ul>
										 <li> The main skill required of the person applying for this job is to understand the technical side of the search 360 tool. Meaning being able to set up campaigns, adjust CPC, create ad copies and then have the skills to communicate it to their clients who may not have any technical knowledge. </li>
									 	 <li>Be an analytical thinker and have high-level problem-solving skills as the role requires you to develop new advertising strategies constantly. You will need to look at previous campaigns and see what went wrong and right, and apply them accordingly to new strategies. </li>
										 <li> Build good relationships and maintain those relationships between the key clients </li>
										 <li> Leadership and management skills are a must for the role </li>

									</ul>
									<p> Qualifications and Experience Required: </p>
									<ul>
										 <li> You must have either a bachelor's degree or the equivalent level of working experience (Google,2022) </li>
										 <li> The role requires a minimum of 5 years of experience that envolves media, marketing or advertising (Google,2022) </li>
										 <li> The role requires the person to have experience managing accounts involving digital advertising. This can be through: Managing clients' Google Ads accounts (preferably high-level businesses), Facebook Ads accounts or any other equivalent ad platform. </li>
									</ul>
								<p style="font-weight:bold;">	A description of the skills, qualifications and experience you currently have. </p>
								<p> Skills I have: </p>
								<ul>
									 <li> Good at communicating with people both through speaking and writing </li>
									 <li> Can work with a team effectively and reach a common consensus   </li>
									 <li> Good at teaching people new concepts that are technical in a easy to understand way </li>
									 <li> My willigness to learn new things is constant </li>


								</ul>
                <p> Qualifications: </p>
								<ul>
								    <li> Diploma of International Business, RMIT University </li>
										<li> Google Ads certificates (Search, Display) </li>
								</ul>
								<p> Experience: </p>
								<ul>
									  <li> Part-time internship for a year at a Digital Marketing Agency </li>
								    <li> 1 Years of experience working in a Digital Marketing Agency as a Google Ads Specialist  </li>
										<li> Experience using Google Ads, Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager, Google Merchant Center  </li>
										<li> Doing keyword research for various industries </li>
										<li> Managing a team and teaching new interns how to use Google tools </li>
								</ul>
								<p style="font-weight:bold;"> A plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position: </p>
								<p>At the current stage of my professional experience, I still have a long way to go before I can reach my dream job as a search 360 lead. Firstly, I don't meet the required professional experience of 5 years that involves some media, advertising or marketing. This is because I only have 1 year of experience working in a digital marketing agency as a Google Ads Specialist and will need to broaden my spectrum of skills to involve different advertising tools. These tools involve Microsoft Ads and Facebook Ads. All of the accounts I have worked with have had a low budget not exceeding 3000$ per month, which puts me at a great disadvantage as search 360 workers are managing millions of dollar budget accounts. I also need a bachelor's degree, which I am currently studying for and only have a semester left. To gain the necessary experience to one day gets this role, I will be looking for high-level google premier agencies rather than partner agencies. Premier agencies are top 3% of the country and work with much larger budgets compared to regular partner agencies. If I can work in an agency like this, I will have first-hand experience working with some of the best firms in Australia and gain valuable knowledge of how they handle such large clients. I will need to eventually work in one of these agencies for the next 4 years and go up in the hierarchy from a regular Google Ads Specialist to a Digital Marketing Manager/Search manager. By the five years, I would have gained the necessary skills, qualifications and experience to work in a search 360 lead role. </p>

									<span class="image"><img src="creativity-score.png" alt="" /></span>

									<h4 style="color:white"> What do the results of these tests mean for you?: </h4>
									<p> I haven't ever taken tests regarding myself online as I always believed they give a general output of the things you selected. However, after taking the tests and reading the traits that come with them, I can relate to the points. Beginning with the Myers-Briggs test, I understood better the type of person I am. What I am struggling with personally—looking at the last category of the test result, "Identity", I struggle with keeping calm during crucial moments and tend to be all over the place. This is something I need to work on, and I believe it is an issue that affects me daily. Furthermore, the test results indicate that I am someone who is extroverted and loves communicating. This is also true; I enjoy spending time with others and working on something with a group of people. For the second test, I can say it is very accurate. For the majority of my school years, I've never been the person to take notes, but rather listen to what the teacher is saying and repeat them out loud in my head. This test solidified my learning method that I am an auditory person and is the main reason I am better at communicating orally. The final test I took wasn't accurate, and the questions asked were too vague. They didn't relate to my creativity level, and the results didn't seem like me. I believe I see things from many different perspectives and relate them to the tasks. The test however, doesn't agree and believes my perspective of things is limited. </p>
